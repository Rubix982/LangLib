# LangLib

## Description

This repository is a one-stop resource for showcasing the vast features of various programming languages. Whether you’re tackling Competitive Programming, Speed Programming challenges, or simply mapping a problem to a built-in structure, it’s easy to feel lost or forget the full capabilities of a language’s libraries.

This project is designed to solve that problem by maintaining organized, language-specific examples of methods, tests, and practical applications of built-in data structures, algorithms, and libraries. It aims to serve as a quick reference and learning tool for developers looking to deepen their expertise and solve problems more efficiently.

## Objectives

- Comprehensive examples of language-specific libraries and methods.
- Tests and practical use cases for solving real-world programming challenges.
- Focused on enabling quick mapping of problems to built-in capabilities.
- Organized by languages for ease of reference and learning.

## Goal

To empower developers with the knowledge to solve problems faster and master the internal details of data structures and algorithms in each language.

## Feedback
